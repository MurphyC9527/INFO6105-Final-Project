# INFO6105-Final-Project

## Required Packages
This project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- joblib

##How to Run the Project
1. Run Part1and2.ipynb (Data Processing + Model Training)

Start by opening the notebook Part1and2.ipynb.
This notebook handles the entire pipeline, including:

Data loading

Data preprocessing and feature encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model evaluation (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix, ROC–AUC)

Saving the best model

To run it, simply execute the cells in order from top to bottom.
No additional configuration is required.

2. Run Part3.ipynb (Demo with Sample CSV)

After completing Part1and2, open Part3.ipynb.
This notebook demonstrates how to load a sample CSV file and apply the previously trained models to make predictions.

Again, run the cells in the order they appear.
